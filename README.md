# Web Scraping Project

Welcome to the Web Scraping Project! This repository houses a Jupyter Notebook that showcases the fascinating process of web scraping using Python. Below, you'll find a detailed description of the various components and functions implemented within the notebook.

## Notebook: Web project.ipynb

### Overview
Dive into the world of web scraping with this Jupyter Notebook, which demonstrates how to extract and manipulate data from websites. The notebook takes you through a step-by-step journey, from sending requests to parsing HTML content and extracting meaningful data.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Importing Libraries**
   - The journey begins with importing essential libraries required for web scraping. These libraries handle everything from sending HTTP requests to parsing and analyzing HTML content.

2. **Sending HTTP Requests**
   - The notebook demonstrates how to send HTTP requests to a specified URL. This is the initial step where we fetch the raw HTML content of the target webpage.

3. **Parsing HTML Content**
   - Once the HTML content is fetched, the next step involves parsing it. The notebook guides you on how to use a parsing library to break down the HTML structure, making it easier to navigate and extract specific elements.

4. **Extracting Data**
   - This section is the heart of the web scraping process. Here, you'll learn how to identify and extract specific data points from the parsed HTML content. The notebook illustrates various techniques to locate and retrieve the desired information from the webpage.

5. **Storing Data**
   - After extracting the data, the notebook shows how to store it in a structured format. This could be a CSV file or a pandas DataFrame, making it easy to analyze and manipulate the data further.

### How to Use

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Ensure you have Jupyter installed on your system.
   - Launch Jupyter by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
   - Navigate to the `Web project.ipynb` file and open it.
   - Execute all the cells sequentially to perform the web scraping tasks.

### Example Workflow

1. Start by importing the necessary libraries for web scraping.
2. Send an HTTP request to your target URL to fetch the HTML content.
3. Parse the fetched HTML content to understand its structure.
4. Extract the specific data points you need from the parsed HTML.
5. Store the extracted data in a structured format, such as a CSV file or a pandas DataFrame.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Required to run and interact with the notebook.
- **Requests Library**: For sending HTTP requests.
- **BeautifulSoup Library**: For parsing HTML content.
- **Pandas Library**: For storing and manipulating the extracted data.
